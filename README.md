# Sketch-to-Real-image-Transformation-using-GAN



This project implements a deep learning-based approach for transforming simple sketches into realistic face images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Leveraging a U-Net architecture with deep convolutional layers, the model achieves high fidelity and detail accuracy. The system is built with TensorFlow and Keras, integrating custom loss functions to enhance the contextual and pixel-based evaluation of generated images. Real-time preview, customizable settings, and robust performance metrics like SSIM and L2-norm make this project a powerful tool for sketch-based image generation.
